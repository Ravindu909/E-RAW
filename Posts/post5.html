								Plant and animal cells share many similarities since they are both
				eukaryotes, which means that they have membrane-bound organelles like the nucleus and
				mitochondria. They also both have cytoplasm, a cell membrane, a nucleus, mitochondria, a Golgi
				apparatus, peroxisomes, ribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, rough endoplasmic
				reticulum, and vacuoles.<br><br>

				The cytoplasm is the gelatinous liquid that fills the inside of a cell.
				It is composed of water, salt, and various organic molecules. The cytoplasm is responsible for
				holding the components of the cell and protecting them from damage. It stores the molecules
				required for cellular processes and is also responsible for giving the cell its shape.

				The cell membrane is an important semi-permeable division between
				the cell and its surroundings. It allows the cell to control its biochemistry by only letting certain
				substances through it. The nucleus is where the genetic information of the cell is housed.
				Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. They are specialized to
				perform aerobic respiration, converting glucose to ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell
				that is used to perform functions necessary for life. The Golgi apparatus is a cell organelle that
				helps process and package proteins and lipid molecules especially proteins destined to be
				exported from the cell.<br><br>

				Peroxisomes metabolize waste. Ribosomes are intercellular structures
				made of both RNA and protein, and it is the site of protein synthesis in the cell. Both rough and
				smooth endoplasmic reticulum help with the production and storage of proteins. The rough
				endoplasmic reticulum is covered in ribosomes, which translate RNA into protein. The smooth
				endoplasmic reticulum makes lipids. Vacuoles are membrane-bound cell organelles that help to
				handle waste products and also get rid of waste products.

				One major difference is that plant cells have a rigid cell wall around
				their plasma membrane. It is composed of cellulose, providing additional stability and protection.
				As a result, plant cells have fixed angular shapes, while animal cells are mostly round and
				irregular.<br><br>

				Another important difference between animal cells and plant cells is
				how they obtain their energy. Plants are autotrophs, which means that they produce their food.
				In contrast, animals are heterotrophs, meaning that they must ingest their food. Plants produce
				sugars through photosynthesis, and then break down the sugar to produce energy. Animals
				consume other organisms such as plants to obtain sugar, which they then also break down to
				produce energy. Again the sugar is broken down in mitochondria.

				Plants are autotrophs thanks to special organelles called chloroplasts,
				which are full of chlorophyll, a green pigment that captures light energy to drive the reactions in
				photosynthesis is the process by which plants use the sun’s energy to make sugar. Once the sugar
				is made, it gets broken down in mitochondria.<br><br>

				Another important difference between plant and animal cells is in their
				vacuoles. Vacuoles in plant cells can occupy up to 90% of the cell’s volume and have a single
				membrane. One of their roles is simply to fill up space but they can also have digestive functions
				similar to lysosomes. Vacuoles have enzymes that perform many functions and can store
				nutrients or provide space to degrade waste substances. Animal cells can also have vacuoles but
				they are much smaller than the large central vacuole in plant cells, there are multiple of them and
				they don’t take up 90% of the space.
				<br><br>
				Plant and animal cells both also have cytoskeletons, which feature
				microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. However, these structures are
				arranged differently in plant and animal cells. Centrioles are present in all animal cells but only
				in lower plant forms, such s Chlamydomonas. Centrioles are microtubule-organizing centers,
				which are structures from which microtubules emerge.</p></br></br>
